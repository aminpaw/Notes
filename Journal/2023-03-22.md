I was thinking about the social experiment done, in a photography class the class was seperated into 2 halves 
one was going to be graded for the number of photos taken while the other for one photo only 
and the results was that the group graded for the number of photos took better photos because they had to take action and take alot of photos and they learned practically how to take good photos, while the second group focused on thinking about the photo that they did not actually know how to take a good photo. 
At first thought i disagreed with the conclusion i understood from this experiment that quantity is better than quality. But after writing it I found out that I misunderstood it.
The experiment did not show that quantitiy is better than quality but rather that training more makes you produce better quality thanbeing a perfectionist that just thinks about the good quality final product rather than actually learning how to produce it.
